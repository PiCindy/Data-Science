Euclid,mathematician,Z,"ancient Greek mathematician, inventor of axiomatic geometry","['Euclid (; Ancient Greek: Εὐκλείδης – Eukleídēs, pronounced [eu̯.kleː.dɛːs]; fl.', '300 BC), sometimes called Euclid of Alexandria to distinguish him from Euclid of Megara, was a Greek mathematician, often referred to as the ""founder of geometry"" or the ""father of geometry"".', 'He was active in Alexandria during the reign of Ptolemy I (323–283 BC).', 'His Elements is one of the most influential works in the history of mathematics, serving as the main textbook for teaching mathematics (especially geometry) from the time of its publication until the late 19th or early 20th century.', 'In the Elements, Euclid deduced the theorems of what is now called Euclidean geometry from a small set of axioms.']"
Colin_Maclaurin,mathematician,Z,Scottish mathematician,"['Colin Maclaurin (; Scottish Gaelic: Cailean MacLabhruinn; February 1698 – 14 June 1746) was a Scottish mathematician who made important contributions to geometry and algebra.', 'He is also known for being a child prodigy and holding the record for being the youngest professor.', 'The Maclaurin series, a special case of the Taylor series, is named after him.', 'Owing to changes in orthography since that time (his name was originally rendered as “M‘Laurine”), his surname is alternatively written MacLaurin.', 'Maclaurin was born in Kilmodan, Argyll.']"
Fibonacci,mathematician,Z,Italian mathematician (c. 1175),"['Fibonacci (; also US: , Italian: [fiboˈnattʃi]; c.\u20091170 – c.\u20091240–50), also known as Leonardo Bonacci, Leonardo of Pisa, or Leonardo Bigollo Pisano (\'Leonardo the Traveller from Pisa\'), was an Italian mathematician from the Republic of Pisa, considered to be ""the most talented Western mathematician of the Middle Ages"".The name he is commonly called, Fibonacci, was made up in 1838 by the Franco-Italian historian Guillaume Libri and is short for filius Bonacci (\'son of Bonacci\').', 'However, even earlier in 1506 a notary of the Holy Roman Empire, Perizolo mentions Leonardo as ""Lionardo Fibonacci"".Fibonacci popularized the Hindu–Arabic numeral system in the Western world primarily through his composition in 1202 of Liber Abaci (Book of Calculation).', 'He also introduced Europe to the sequence of Fibonacci numbers, which he used as an example in Liber Abaci.', 'Fibonacci was born around 1170 to Guglielmo, an Italian merchant and customs official.', 'Guglielmo directed a trading post in Bugia, Algeria.']"
Joseph_Fourier,mathematician,Z,French mathematician and physicist (1768 – 1830),"['Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier (; French: [fuʁje]; 21 March 1768 – 16 May 1830) was a French mathematician and physicist born in Auxerre and best known for initiating the investigation of Fourier series, which eventually developed into Fourier analysis and harmonic analysis, and their applications to problems of heat transfer and vibrations.', ""The Fourier transform and Fourier's law of conduction are also named in his honour."", 'Fourier is also generally credited with the discovery of the greenhouse effect.', 'Fourier was born at Auxerre (now in the Yonne département of France), the son of a tailor.', 'He was orphaned at the age of nine.']"
